Allow the control node (your Ansible machine) to SSH into all 10 managed hosts **without a password**, using SSH keys for the user `ansibleu`.

---

#  Step‑by‑Step Setup

## **1️ Create the user on all managed hosts**
If the user doesn’t exist yet:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ansibleu
sudo passwd ansibleu   # optional if you want a fallback password
```

If you want this user to run sudo without password:

```bash
echo "ansibleu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansibleu
```

---

## **2️ Generate SSH key on the Ansible control node**
Run this on your control machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible key"
```

Press Enter for default path (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and **no password**.

---

## **3️ Copy the public key to each managed host**
You can do it manually:

```bash
ssh-copy-id ansibleu@host1
ssh-copy-id ansibleu@host2
...
ssh-copy-id ansibleu@host10
```

Or automate it with a loop:

```bash
for host in host1 host2 host3 host4 host5 host6 host7 host8 host9 host10; do
    ssh-copy-id ansibleu@$host
done
```

This creates:

```
/home/ansibleu/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

with correct permissions.

---

## **4️ Verify password‑less login**
Test:

```bash
ssh ansibleu@host1
```

If it logs in without asking for a password, you're good.

---

# Do it the Ansible way (recommended)

Create a simple playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure ansibleu exists
      user:
        name: ansibleu
        shell: /bin/bash
        create_home: yes

    - name: Install authorized key
      authorized_key:
        user: ansibleu
        state: present
        key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub') }}"
```

Run it:

```bash
ansible-playbook setup-ansible-user.yml
```

This is cleaner, repeatable, and exactly the kind of automation you prefer.
